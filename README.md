Project 2-1: Calculate a rectangle’s area and perimeter Console
￼
Welcome to the Area and Perimeter Calculator
Enter length: 100
Enter width:  200
Area:         20000.0
Perimeter:    600.0
Continue? (y/n): y
Enter length: 8
Enter width:  4
Area:         32.0
Perimeter:    24.0
Continue? (y/n): n
￼Operation
 The application prompts the user to enter values for the length and width of a rectangle.
 The application displays the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
 The application prompts the user to continue. Specifications
 The formulas for calculating area are perimeter are:
   area = width * length
   perimeter = 2 * width + 2 * length
 The application should accept decimal entries like 10.5 and 20.65.
 Assume that the user will enter valid numeric data for the length and width.
 The application should continue only if the user enters “y” or “Y” to continue.
